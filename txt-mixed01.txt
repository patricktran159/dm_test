My experience at the University Of Technology, Sydney has been mixed. On the one hand, the professors have been incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about their subjects. On the other hand, the administrative bureaucracy and lack of communication has made some aspects of my education frustrating. Overall, I have learned a lot, but there is definitely room for improvement.
