My time at university has been a rollercoaster ride with highs and lows. On one hand, I've had some amazing professors who have challenged and inspired me, but on the other hand, the bureaucracy and administrative hurdles have been frustrating. Overall, it's been a mixed experience, but I'm grateful for the opportunities it has provided me.
